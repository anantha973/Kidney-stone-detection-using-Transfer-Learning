## Overview

This project uses **CNN and Transfer learning** to classify medical images related to kidney stone detection. By fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network model, we aim to build a robust classifier with high accuracy while avoiding the need for training from scratch.

Transfer learning enables us to use a model that has been trained on a large dataset (such as ImageNet) and adapt it to our kidney stone detection task, providing faster convergence and better results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of medical images, including kidney stone presence indicators. You can modify this section to describe the exact dataset and image types, including their structure and the preprocessing steps applied.

## Model

The notebook implements transfer learning using a **pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN)** model. The following steps are included:

1. Importing a pre-trained model such as VGG16, ResNet, or Inception.
2. Fine-tuning the model for binary or multi-class classification.
3. Adding custom layers on top of the base model to fit the classification task.
4. Compiling the model with suitable loss functions and optimizers.

### Pre-trained Models Used:

* Models: CNN, Inception-V3
* Additional layers added for classification

## Results

The model achieves satisfactory results with accuracy and loss metrics showing clear improvement after fine-tuning. Key evaluation metrics include:

* **Training Accuracy**: 100%
* **Validation Accuracy**: 99.92%
